    "1. Manipulate a dataset in Python/Pandas/Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "2. Learn about the importance of pre-processing your dataset, as well as how to do so. You should learn about:\n",
    "    * Various ways to truncate and subset your data.\n",
    "    * Normalizing your dataset in preparation for training and testing.\n",
    "3. Learn how to apply the `scikit-learn` Linear Regression model to a real-world dataset, based on concepts that we covered in class. You should learn about:\n",

    "    * Creating a model. \n",
    "    * Combining data and metrics from multiple models.\n",

    "We will cover the topic of regularization in class next week. For now, try out the `Ridge` and `Lasso` linear models in place of `LinearRegression`. In particular, explore how different values of the `alpha` parameter affect performance. (Hint: the `scikit-learn` documentation for [Ridge](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html) and [Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) will be helpful.) \n",

    "Comment on your results from changing this parameter when fitting models predicting `duration` using the four features used above (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and snowfall). How did changing the regularization parameter affect performance? Note that this question is intentionally meant to be open-ended to give you a chance to experiment with these parameters. "
